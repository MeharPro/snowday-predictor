            <p>Every winter morning, thousands of students in Oakville, Burlington, Milton, and Halton Hills wake up
                asking the same question: <strong>"Is it a snow day?"</strong></p>

            <p>But long before your alarm goes off, a dedicated team at Halton Student Transportation Services (HSTS)
                has been awake for hours, analyzing data to make that critical call. While it might seem random, the
                decision to close schools is based on a precise, time-sensitive protocol.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The decision isn't just about snow accumulation. It's about safety, road
                conditions, and whether buses can run on time.
            </div>

            <h2>The 4:00 AM Wake-Up Call</h2>
            <p>The process begins at approximately <strong>4:00 AM</strong>. While most of Halton Region is sleeping,
                HSTS staff begin reviewing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environment Canada Warnings:</strong> Checking for snowfall warnings, freezing rain, or
                    extreme cold alerts.</li>
                <li><strong>Spotter Reports:</strong> HSTS has "spotters" across the region—real people who check road
                    conditions in Zones 1, 2, and 3.</li>
                <li><strong>Municipal PLow Updates:</strong> contacting road crews in Oakville, Burlington, Milton, and
                    Halton Hills to see if main arteries are cleared.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Three Zones of Halton</h2>
            <p>Halton is huge. Weather in Oakville (Zone 1) near the lake can be totally different from Georgetown (Zone
                3) near the escarpment. HSTS divides the region into three zones to make more targeted decisions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Zone 1:</strong> Oakville and Burlington (South)</li>
                <li><strong>Zone 2:</strong> Milton (Central)</li>
                <li><strong>Zone 3:</strong> Halton Hills / Georgetown (North)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Often, you'll see "Buses Cancelled in Zone 3 only" while Zone 1 remains open. This keeps schools running
                where it's safe.</p>

            <h2>The 6:30 AM Deadline</h2>
            <p>A decision <strong>must</strong> be made by 6:00 AM to ensure it can be communicated to media and parents
                by 6:30 AM. Once the bus fleet is deployed, it's very difficult to recall them. That's why you rarely
                see a cancellation after 6:30 AM.</p>

            <h2>Does 10cm of Snow Close Schools?</h2>
            <p>Many students believe there's a magic number. Our historical analysis shows that HDSB has closed schools
                with as little as <strong>10cm of snow</strong> if other conditions are bad (e.g., freezing rain or
                unplowed roads). However, we've also seen school stay open with 15cm if the roads were clear and the sun
                was out.</p>
