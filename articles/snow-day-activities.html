            <p>The call came in at 6:15 AM: <strong>"All schools are closed."</strong> You've got a free day! Instead of
                staying in bed all day (though that's nice too), here are the best ways to enjoy the winter wonderland
                in Halton Region.</p>

            <h2>1. Hit the Legendary Toboggan Hills</h2>
            <p>Halton is home to some of the best sledding in the GTA. Our top picks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bronte Creek Provincial Park (Oakville):</strong> A classic spot with a huge hill near the
                    day-use area. Perfect for all ages.</li>
                <li><strong>Lowville Park (Burlington):</strong> Steep, fast, and incredibly scenic. A favorite for
                    thrill-seekers.</li>
                <li><strong>Sixteen Mile Creek (Oakville):</strong> Various spots along the trails offer great impromptu
                    sledding.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Skate at Unique Outdoor Rinks</h2>
            <p>If the roads are safe enough to drive, check out the <strong>Rotary Centennial Pond</strong> in
                Burlington or the outdoor rink at <strong>Trafalgar Park</strong> in Oakville. There's nothing like
                skating outdoors while snow falls gently around you.</p>

            <h2>3. Build an Igloo (or Quinzhee)</h2>
            <p>With the heavy, packing snow we often get in Southern Ontario, building a snow fort is a rite of passage.
                Try building a "quinzhee"—mound up a huge pile of snow, let it settle for a few hours (have hot
                chocolate while you wait), and then hollow it out.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Safety Tip:</strong> Never tunnel into snowbanks near the road. Plows cannot see you! Stick to
                the backyard.
            </div>

            <h2>4. Winter Photography Hike</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Bruce Trail</strong> near Milton or <strong>Mount Nemo Conservation Area</strong> offer
                breathtaking views when covered in fresh snow. The contrast of white snow against the Niagara Escarpment
                cliffs is Instagram gold.</p>

            <h2>5. The Ultimate Hot Chocolate Tour</h2>
            <p>Once you're frozen solid, warm up at local gems. We recommend checking out the cafes in Downtown Oakville
                or Village Square in Burlington for the richest hot cocoa.</p>

            <p>Enjoy your day off! And remember to check the <a href="/">Snow Day Predictor</a> tonight to see if you'll
                be lucky enough to get two days in a row.</p>
