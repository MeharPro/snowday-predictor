            <h1>About Snow Day Predictor</h1>

            <p>Welcome to <strong>Snow Day Predictor</strong>, the most accurate and reliable school closure prediction
                tool for the Halton Region and Greater Toronto Area.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>We built this tool to solve a simple problem: the uncertainty of winter mornings. Students want to know
                if they should finish that homework, and parents need to know if they need to arrange childcare. We
                believe you shouldn't have to wait until 6:30 AM to have a good idea of what's coming.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Unlike other "magic 8-ball" apps, our predictor is built on <strong>hard data</strong>. We have analyzed
                over 10 years of historical school closure records from the Halton District School Board (HDSB) and
                Halton Catholic District School Board (HCDSB).</p>

            <p>Our algorithm correlates this historical data with real-time weather metrics from Open-Meteo and
                Environment Canada, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Total snow accumulation (cm)</li>
                <li>Snowfall intensity (cm/hour)</li>
                <li>Timing of the storm (overnight vs. day)</li>
                <li>Wind chill and temperature</li>
                <li>Wind speed and visibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Team</h2>
            <p>We are a team of developers and data enthusiasts based in Oakville, Ontario. We understand the local
                geography—how the "snow belt" north of Dundas affects closures differently than the lakeshore
                conditions.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>Have questions, suggestions, or found a bug? We'd love to hear from you.</p>
