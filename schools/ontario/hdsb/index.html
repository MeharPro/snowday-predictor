                    <h3>Will HDSB schools be cancelled tomorrow?</h3>
                    <p>Use our Snow Day Predictor with your Halton Region postal code to check. We analyze real-time
                        weather data including snowfall, temperature, wind speed, and visibility. HDSB announces
                        closures by 6:30 AM via their website and Twitter @HDSB.</p>

                    <h3>When does HDSB announce school closures?</h3>
                    <p>Halton Student Transportation Services (HSTS) begins monitoring weather at <strong>4:00
                            AM</strong>. Decisions are typically announced by <strong>6:30 AM</strong> through the HDSB
                        website, Twitter @HDSB, the HDSB mobile app, and local news (CP24, CTV Toronto).</p>

                <article class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much snow does it take to cancel HDSB schools?</h3>
                    <p>Based on historical data, HDSB has closed with as little as <strong>10cm of snow</strong> when
                        combined with other factors. Key factors: timing of snowfall (morning rush hour is critical),
                        intensity, temperature, wind chill, visibility, and road conditions.</p>

                <article class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is HSTS and how does it affect closures?</h3>
                    <p>Halton Student Transportation Services (HSTS) manages school buses for both HDSB and HCDSB. When
                        HSTS cancels buses, schools often close. Check <a href="https://www.hsts.on.ca/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener" style="color: var(--primary-light);">hsts.on.ca</a> for bus cancellation

                <article class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does HDSB close when HCDSB closes?</h3>
                    <p>Not always! HDSB and HCDSB (Halton Catholic) make independent decisions. However, both use HSTS
                        for buses, so if buses are cancelled, both boards are typically affected.</p>
